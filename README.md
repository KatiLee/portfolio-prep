# Communication for Better Coding

## Full Stack Junior Developer working on a concentration in Agile


Allow me to introduce myself, I am Katherine Lee, junior full stack developer, at your service. 
Full stack developer, you ask yourself. 
And yes, indeed, I am. 
It took years of working in hot kitchens, and developing rooms, the basement of a hospital and a pandemic, for me to think to myself, maybe, this isn’t where it’s at.
So I took my passion for learning new skills to technology. 
Here I stand in front of you, a changed woman.
I can now utilize http, javascript, css, react, render, netlify, mongoDB, and github just with a touch of my fingers, like the wave of a wand.
I can build you a front end, I can build you a back end with a server, I can make you an application that runs effectively and looks good doing it. 
Need a database? Which kind? I’ve got you covered. 
They say communication is key, so, come talk to me about being a developer for you!

I love creating applications, but I am also excited to learn more! I would to love to learn more about geocoding in the future. I also plan to learn more about utilizing the Agile methodology in the work space.
